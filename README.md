**The Tolino servers DO NOT support reasonable secure TLS handshakes and a custom OpenSSL config is used to connect insecurely. Proceed only if you understand the risks and potential mitigations **

### Compatibility

This is expected to work with:
* Tolino Vision 4 HD (only one tested)
* Tolino Vision 3 HD
* Tolino Vision 2
* Tolino Shine 2 HD
* Tolino Page

But might be adaptable to the other Tolino devices as well

### Troubleshooting

If this script does not yield you a working image double modify the script to use the
original ramdisk and check if the generated boot.img is matching your update_package/boot.img


### Getting root:

Root can be aquired on Android 4 based readern via SuperSU.
Sadly the SuperSU website is no longer online and archive.org only has the
download page with the md5sum saved.

The zip included in this repo matches this checksum, so lets hope for the best :/
